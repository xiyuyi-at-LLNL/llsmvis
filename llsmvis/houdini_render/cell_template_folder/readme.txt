0. Make sure you've ran Houdini 19 at least once after installing it. That will make sure it correctly registers the apprentice license.

1. Put t00.stl to t49.stl in the "mesh" folder (create it if it does not exist.)

2. Modify render.sh to the correct Houdini install path and run the script in a command line. This will generate 50x6=300 rendered images in a folder called "render".
