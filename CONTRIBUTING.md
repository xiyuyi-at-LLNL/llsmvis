## Contributing Guidelines

`llsmvis` is an open source project. We welcome contributions via pull requests as well as questions, 
feature requests, or bug reports via issues. 
Please also refer to our 
[code of conduct](https://github.com/xiyuyi-at-LLNL/llsmvis/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you are a developer, create a branch, include your changes and create a pull request to merge your branch to the master branch. 
If you are not an existing developer of the project, first create a fork of the repository. This will create your copy of the `llsmvis` repository 
and ensure you can push your changes up to GitHub through pull requests.

If you'd like to become a developer, please send a message to the corresponding authors of the following manuscript:

Yi, X., Miao, H., Lo, J. K. Y., Elsheikh, M., Lee, T. H., Jiang, C., ... & Laurence, T. A. (2022). A Tailored Approach To Study Legionella Infection Using Lattice Light Sheet Microscope (LLSM). bioRxiv.

* Create your branches off the `repo:main` branch.
* Clearly name your branches, commits, and PRs as this will help us manage queued work in a timely manner.
* Articulate your commit messages in the imperative (e.g., `Adds new privacy policy link to README`).
* Commit your work in logically organized commits, and group commits together logically in a PR.
* Title each PR clearly and give it an unambiguous description.
* Review existing issues before opening a new one. Your issue might already be under development or 
discussed by others. Feel free to add to any outstanding issue/bug.
* Be explicit when opening issues and reporting bugs. What behavior are you expecting? 
What is your justification or use case for the new feature/enhancement? How can the bug be recreated? What are any environment variables to consider?
